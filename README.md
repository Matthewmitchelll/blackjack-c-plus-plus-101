My First C-Plus-Plus Project - Blackjack

This was my first term Uni project.
Visual Studio 12 Project.
Updated to Visual Studio 15 Community.

Created using the new Windows 8 Console features,
it is an interactive simplified blackjack game.

Features include:
-Screen Handler for rendering ASCII art with 
  double buffer to remove screen writing flicker.
-Input handler to allow for continued game loop
  whilst waiting for input
-Showcases object oriented programming concepts
